Hello, World! This is my first post here on LexTech so I figured I should walk you through my journey thus far regarding tech. Perhaps some of you might relate, perhaps some of you might find it inspiring or perhaps some of you might find it boring. I just want to shed some light on my specific process because I feel that it's only fair to so as my first-ever blog post. So here it goes.

Hi! I'm Alex. Ever since I was a little kid, I've been obcessed with technology. I remember from a very young age I started telling people that I wanted to be an "Engenheiro Informático", which is Portuguese for "Computer Scientist" or "Software Engineer". However, when I was young, all I knew was that I enjoyed seeing the evolution in technology. I spent countless hours watching youtube videos about different devices including computers, smartphones, tablets, consoles and all that. Because of that I decided that I wanted to dedicate my life to "building computers and tinkering with them". Mind you, back then I was about 10-12 years old and for some reason, I thought that an "Engenheiro Informático" built computers for a living, which was totally wrong but we'll get there.

I was one of the few people in my class that actually was spending a lot of his free time browsing the Internet. I already had a pretty good sensitivity to understand interfaces in the web and also through a Windows computer as when I was about 5 years old I got my first personal computer, which was called "Magalhães". It was a actually a pretty big thing here in Portugal. The Magalhães was running both Windows XP and Linux Caixa Mágica on dual-boot, so me and most of the kids my age, quickly got acquainted with those systems. I remember vividly playing Super Tux on that Linux distribution and Pokemon Ruby on a GameBoy Advance emulator on Windows XP. I guess the Magalhães was actually my first interaction with a PC where I had any idea of what I was doing (even though I actually had very little ideas of waht I was doing).

That whole experience later led me to other computers. When I reached 10 years old, my parents bought me a new computer which, for me it was like finally having an "adult computer". That's where I really became agile when interacting with these machines. This new PC finally had WiFi and was actually powerful enough to play a few "serious" games like Minecraft, which was also a great source of knowledge for me. It tought me not only how to survive if I ever was left alone on a block-world, but it was also the first time I tinkered with a computer. Back then I really got into drawing and creating my own Minecraft texture packs and then importing them into my game. I was able to go throught the files of an existing texture pack and replacing the existing textures with the ones I made or with ones from other texture packs and so I was getting a version of Minecraft that had the visuals that were customized to my liking.

At that stage, I got into image editing with Photoshop and also video editing with Sony Vegas Pro, since that's what all my favorite Minecraft youtubers said they were using to edit their videos. (I might've even dabbled a bit with youtubing myself using Fraps but we won't get into that). At that point, I was agile enough with a computer to stand out from my pears in the IT classes, which of course tought very basic things, but at those basic things, I was one of the best. I became that kid that the teachers would sometimes go to when their computers had any problems, you know?

After those experiences, I figured "wow, I'm pretty good at and really enjoy spending time exploring these computer things, i wish I could make that into a profession". And that's when my parents told me about this "Engenheiro Informático" profession that was all about computers. BINGO! That's what I want to become.

Fast-forward a few years and I finally discovered that this profession I was seeking was actually about programming, not really about tinkering with computers. "Dang-it", I thought, "I don't even know what that is...". I'd already spent the last years of my life telling me everyone I knew about what I wanted to become when I was an adult and now I had discovered that it wasn't what I thought it was. But I guess at this time I decided to accept the fact that it was more about programming than anything and still go through with it, since it's still related to computers and from what I heard it was one of the best-paying professions one could have since demand kept on increasing for jobs of this positions. At least that's what my parents told me.

When I was about 16 years old I started to learn at least the bascis in programming, just so I could get a little head start. I knew that the following school year, I would have an IT class were they would teach us how to build webpages with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so that's what I started learning first. I started with HTML and I can't tell you how satisfying it was for me to have built my first webpage ever. Granted, it was a less than 10 lines html file that only wrote "Hello, World!" without any styling whatsoever but hey,that was enough for me to think "damn, I'm a programmer now". When classes started, I build my first "serious" webpage using only HTML and CSS. It was like a Batman website with embedded images and videos and pages for different characters from the Batman universe. It was obviously a static page but, for me, it was my first "professional looking" website.

Then it was time to finally learn some actual programming. The task was to either integrate dynamic JavaScript elements into that static website we had created or built an entire dynamic website from scratch. We opter for the second option and built a quiz website where you would answer a couple of random questions and then it would assign you a character based on your answers. This wasn't an incredible success in the class (nor the grade) but at least it was a funny little goofy website. It was enough to make me and my friend laugh.

The rest of that IT course pretty fun as well. After that website stuff during the first tern, we got to explore image and audio editing in the second and video editing in the third. I was pretty satisfied with my performance during those stages, thanks to my previous youtuber phase were I learned a lot of was being tought in those classes.

## University

At 18 years old, I finally got into University, after a great amount of stress to get the grades to do so. I got into "Computer Science and Computer Engineering" at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL). Even though this wasn't my first option, my studies at ISEL are what REALLY defined the Software Developer that I am today.
