Hi there! I'm **Alexandre Madeira**, or **Alex** for short, and welcome to my corner of the internet.

I started this blog to talk about the things I love in the tech world. My passion lies in both **hardware** and **software**, and I enjoy exploring the fascinating intersection between them.

On the **hardware side**, I'm fascinated by everything from the latest phones and computers to gaming consoles and retro systems. I love keeping up with new device releases and staying current with updates in the hardware world.

When it comes to **software**, I love tinkering and tweaking my devices to transform them into their most practical and productive forms across different operating systems. I'm particularly drawn to Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS, where I enjoy diving into terminals and customizing environments. As a software developer by day (and often by night!), I also enjoy sharing insights about programming and development practices. I'm also a gaming enthusiast, from modern indies to retro classics, with a particular interest in emulation.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I share my thoughts on the ever-evolving tech landscape. Here, you'll discover:

- **Hardware insights** about new device releases, gaming consoles, and retro systems
- **Software tweaks and tips** for optimizing Unix-based systems and workflows
- **Programming tutorials** covering development concepts, tools, and frameworks
- **Code examples** and practical solutions to real-world problems
- **Insights and discussions** about the latest trends in software development
- **Technical deep-dives** into topics that fascinate me in the tech world
- **Maybe occasionally** some non-tech stuff like movies or superheroes (no promises though!)

## My Mission

My goal is to create content that's both informative and accessible, whether you're exploring hardware for the first time, diving into Unix systems, or you're a seasoned developer looking for fresh perspectives on programming and workflows. I believe in learning by doing and sharing knowledge openly with the community.

## A Bit About Me

I've always been obsessed with technology and knew early on that I wanted to make it my career. I was fortunate to have access to computers from a young age, which allowed me to explore and learn about technology hands-on. Over the years, I've studied and honed my skills in software development, working on various projects and collaborating with other developers.

When I'm not coding or tinkering with tech, you can find me diving into a good book, binge-watching the latest movies and TV shows, or gaming on one of the many handheld consoles I own (and yes, I might have a slight collection problem). I'm a huge fan of pop culture, science fiction, rock music, puzzle solving, and anything that challenges my mind.

## Let's Connect

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about tech. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts!

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something valuable here at LexTech.
